Starship robots are advanced devices that can carry items within a 4-mile (6km) radius. Our delivery platform enables a new era of instant delivery that works around your schedule at much lower costs.

Parcels, groceries and food are directly delivered from stores, at the time that the customer requests via a mobile app. Once ordered the robotsâ€™ entire journey and location can be monitored on a smartphone.
