  **Today marks the next step in BMW’s “Next”** concept program, _previewing the
  company’s future._ It’s the most exciting step, too, because this particular
  concept is called the BMW Vision M Next. As this “Next” ground is still
  relatively untrodden, we’ll make it clear that M means the same thing here as
  it does for every BMW M car. This particular firecracker is meant to give us a
  taste of what’s coming to BMW’s M division, electrification and all.

  he shape and stature of the car instantly screams i8 at us. However, the
  actual design and styling is new and unique to itself. More than anything, it
  looks like a worthy evolution of the i8, previewed in concept form. When we
  get to the powertrain details, it sounds even more like such a vehicle. BMW
  didn’t make it a fully electric car. `Instead, it’s a plug-in hybrid with a
  turbocharged `four-cylinder drinking gasoline. We aren’t privy to the engine’s
  specs, but BMW says the combined system output is 600 horsepower. That’s good
  for 0-62 mph in 3.0 seconds and a top speed of 186 mph. Recalling the i8, that
  car has a turbocharged three-cylinder combined with an electric motor that
  makes 369 horsepower in total. The M Next is capable of driving 62 miles
  electric-only on a full charge, while the i8 is only capable of 18 miles.
  Needless to say, the M Next is a `huge step forward` in every way.
